Tampering:
Do you see the potentially malicious hyperlink being injected into the form? 
Yes, the hyperlinked work "Gotcha" appears above the name input bar, and leads to google.com when clicked on.
Repeat the same steps with **secure.ts**. Do you see any difference. Why?
In secure.ts I found that the form ignores the script and does not execute it. The script shows up
as the person's name once logged in, and does not inject a hyperlink onto the login webpage. This is 
because the input it sanitized in secure.ts to prevent XSS attacks.
